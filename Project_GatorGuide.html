								Gator Guide was a project I worked on with Case Zumbrum and Louis Li with the goal to create a website where students in the
								College of Engineering at UF could plan out which classes they were going to take in their '4 Year Plan'. To do this we set up
								a website which connects to the course and major APIs of the university to identify what classes you need to take and give information
								to the students such as what prerequisites they are currently missing.
							</p>
							<p>
								My main contributions lie in desigining the layout for the website and the interactions the users can have. I built the UI for the 
								login, signup, dashboard and plan-builder interfaces and was in charge of the visual design and front facing aspects of the site.

									The Website is available to view by clicking on the title of this page if you are interested. After creating an account you
									can mess around with the plan builder and dashboard if you're interested. Otherwise, the GitHub for the site can be found
									by clicking on the icon. This the first website I made where I was happy with the visual design and layout of it so I am 
									fond of it. Plus I made the logo that's used as the icon for the site which was fun!
