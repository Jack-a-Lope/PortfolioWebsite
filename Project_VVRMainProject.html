									<h2>Vascular VR Main Project</h2>
									<p>Built using Unity 3D & C#</p>
								</header>
							</div>

							<p>
								I contributed to this project as a part of my work on the Vascular VR at the UF Surf Lab. The goal of this project is to
								create a tool for medical professionals where they can take in stacks of medical scans (MRI or CT), select structures based
								off of Isovalues and generate a voxel cloud that they can interact with in 3D space or VR. This cloud would act as a 3D
								render of the scans through Lego-Stippling. Like the Rendering Style Study, I cannot share the code as it is not my property,
								but I was given permission to share screenshots of the product to demonstrate my work.
							</p>
							<p>
								My role is to work on the data selection tool and generally make it better. The data selection is the grey region with the actual
								medical scans in the image above. Prior to joining, the selections only allowed for one selection box to be drawn which would inform
								the selection region for all slices included, but this isn't ideal as it adds a lot of noise if the structure isn't in the same region
								accross the majority of the stack. Ergo, I updated this to allow for keyframe selections to be made with the system interpolating 
								between them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, I am working on improving it to allow for selections on multiple stacks to inform the voxel generation at the same time. 
								By multiple stacks, I am referring to the coronal, axial and sagital scans of the organic subject that are taken from front-to-back,
								top-to-bottom and left-to-right respectively and these can be seen in the image as the differnet medical scans on the right. By 
								taking in information from all of the stacks at once, the resulting cloud will be more accurate as it won't be filling in the gaps 
								between each scan without thinking and instead be informed by the other two which intersect it.

									<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This project is extremely interesting and I am lucky to be a part of something where I can grow my skills and have an immediate
									tangible impact. It is part of what has spurred me to try and learn more about VR and AR technologies, gave me the foundation of
									Unity experience that I work from today and is frankly the coolest thing I am able to work on.
