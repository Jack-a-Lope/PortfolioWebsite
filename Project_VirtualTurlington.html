								VT is probably the earliest thing I could even call a programming project of mine. I made it with a group of friends freshman
								year for a hackathon and it was pretty much a crash course in learning how Web Dev worked in any capacity. The idea for the site
								was to be a centralized place for people to advertise club events to people who were interested and become a 'Virtual Turlington'
								with Turlington Plaza being one of the main advertisement spots. We ended up making a functioning dashboard with a posting system,
								but ulitmately the project had a long way to go to be viable and wasn't continued after the hackathon. We never hosted it online
								so the only remnants are the icons and the GitHub repo. On that note, I designed the icon and banner for the site which you can
								see above.

									This is a project was a learning experience and while not successful by any means, is a great way to look back on where I started
									in comparison to where I am now. Overall, I look back fondly on making it.
