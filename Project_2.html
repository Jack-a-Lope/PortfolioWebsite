								This project was the natural continuation of my 2D Boids Experiment. Like in that one, this focusses on having many small,
								independent objects performing flocking behavior (boids) while tracking goals and avoiding obstacles. These are also
								governed by the principles of avoidance, alignment and cohession where they avoid colliding with neighbors, attempt to stay
								alligned with their neighbors and attempt to be as close to the center of their local group as they can. Put together,
								this is what forms the "flocks" of objects flying around the scene.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, the behavior of the boids is governed by attempts to move towards the center of their space while avoiding
								the cube placed there. The attraction is stronger the further they are from it which keeps them bound in the area, but they
								seek to avoid the cube which leads to an interaction where they float closely around its surface.

									<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This is a project to create swarms of 3D objects that can be controlled through targets and obstacles and was a
									success! If you want to try it out (and I recommend you do because its mesmerizing to watch) you can access it through
									the GitHub link above. I hope you enjoy and don't lose too much time to staring at it!
