									<h2>Mesh Deformation Project</h2>

								In this project, I wanted to dynamically update the model of a mesh to reflect outside stimuli that would happen on it
								similar to soft surfaces in real life. To mimic this I made it so that clicking on the object would deform the surrounding
								region of the model. This worked by taking the distance from the point of contact to each vertex and applying a force to move
								away from the initial point with exponential decay. Then this would ripple out to neighboring points and repeat until it fell
								lower than a customizeable value. At the same time, there is a restoring force that is meant to return the model to its original state by pulling vertices back
								to their original local positions.
							</p>
							<p>
								When put together, these forces can create many effects by customizing different values. If the restoring force is greater than
								one, then the object will eventually return to its initial state, while values less than one will ultimately stop with some 
								degree of deformation. Mass values can make the vertices less or more responsive to the input, changing how pronounced the effect
								is and by manipulating the distance decay, varrying amounts of the objects are effected at once.

									<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The result of this project is a script that can allow for different outside inputs to manipulate the actual meshes of 3D
									objects in Unity. If you want to try it for yourself, the GitHub Repo for this can be found through the icon at the top
									of the page. I included an option for the object to have constant, random inputs if you just want to see it for yourself
									and I included both a sphere and a custom railing model (with poor topology) to act a demonstration pieces. Enjoy!
